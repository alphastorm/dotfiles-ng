# dotfiles-ng

my dotfiles and configuration stuff (v2).  inspired by:

* *mainly* [Kraymer/F-dotfiles](https://github.com/Kraymer/F-dotfiles) (organization scheme)
* [davehughes/dotfiles](https://github.com/davehughes/dotfiles) (setup/update scripts)

## install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alphastorm/dotfiles-ng.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/setup.sh
```

when needed, special install instructions are in each package's `README.md`.
